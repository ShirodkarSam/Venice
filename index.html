        <h1> Venice </h1>

        <p style="color:rgb(255, 0, 166); font-size: 22px;"> 
            Venice (/ˈvɛnɪs/ VEN-iss; Italian: Venezia [veˈnɛttsja] (listen); Venetian: Venesia [veˈnɛsja], 
            outdatedly Venexia [veˈnɛzja]) is a city in northeastern Italy and the capital of the Veneto 
            region. It is built on a group of 118 small islands that are separated by expanses of open water
             and by canals; portions of the city are linked by over 400 bridges. The islands are in the 
             shallow Venetian Lagoon, an enclosed bay lying between the mouths of the Po and the Piave rivers 
             (more exactly between the Brenta and the Sile). In 2020, around 258,685 people resided in greater 
             Venice or the Comune di Venezia, of whom around 51,000 live in the historical island city of 
             Venice (centro storico) and the rest on the mainland (terraferma). Together with the cities of 
             Padua and Treviso, Venice is included in the Padua-Treviso-Venice Metropolitan Area (PATREVE), 
             which is considered a statistical metropolitan area, with a total population of 2.6 million.

            The name is derived from the ancient Veneti people who inhabited the region by the 10th century 
            BC. The city was historically the capital of the Republic of Venice for almost a millennium,
             from 810 to 1797. It was a major financial and maritime power during the Middle Ages and 
             Renaissance, and a staging area for the Crusades and the Battle of Lepanto, as well as an 
             important centre of commerce—especially silk, grain, and spice, and of art from the 13th century 
             to the end of the 17th. The city-state of Venice is considered to have been the first real 
             international financial centre, emerging in the 9th century and reaching its greatest prominence 
             in the 14th century. This made Venice a wealthy city throughout most of its history. For 
             centuries Venice possessed numerous territories along the Adriatic Sea and within the Italian 
             peninsula, leaving a significant impact on the architecture and culture that can still be seen 
             today. The sovereignty of Venice came to an end in 1797, at the hands of Napoleon. 
             Subsequently, in 1866, the city became part of the Kingdom of Italy.

            Venice has been known as "La Dominante", "La Serenissima", "Queen of the Adriatic", "City of Water"
            , "City of Masks", "City of Bridges", "The Floating City", and "City of Canals". The lagoon and the
             historic parts of the city within the lagoon were inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 
             1987, covering an area of 70,176.4 hectares (173,410 acres). In view of the fact that Venice 
             and its lagoon are under constant threat in terms of their ecology and the safeguarding of the 
             cultural heritage, Venice's UNESCO listing has been under constant examination by UNESCO. 
             Parts of Venice are renowned for the beauty of their settings, their architecture, and artwork.
              Venice is known for several important artistic movements—especially during the Renaissance 
              period—and has played an important role in the history of instrumental and operatic music; it is 
              the birthplace of Baroque composers Tomaso Albinoni and Antonio Vivaldi.

            Although no surviving historical records deal directly with the founding of Venice, tradition and 
            the available evidence have led several historians to agree that the original population of Venice 
            consisted of refugees—from nearby Roman cities such as Padua, Aquileia, Treviso, Altino, and 
            Concordia (modern Portogruaro), as well as from the undefended countryside—who were fleeing 
            successive waves of Germanic and Hun invasions. This is further supported by the documentation 
            on the so-called "apostolic families", the twelve founding families of Venice who elected the first
             doge, who in most cases trace their lineage back to Roman families. Some late Roman sources 
             reveal the existence of fishermen, on the islands in the original marshy lagoons, who were 
             referred to as incolae lacunae ("lagoon dwellers"). The traditional founding is identified with 
             the dedication of the first church, that of San Giacomo on the islet of Rialto (Rivoalto, "High 
             Shore")—said to have taken place at the stroke of noon on 25 March 421 (the Feast of the 
             Annunciation).

        <p style="color:rgb(255, 0, 166); font-size: 22px;"> 
            Beginning as early as AD 166–168, the Quadi and Marcomanni destroyed the main Roman town in the 
            area, present-day Oderzo. This part of Roman Italy was again overrun in the early 5th century by 
            the Visigoths and, some 50 years later, by the Huns led by Attila. The last and most enduring 
            immigration into the north of the Italian peninsula, that of the Lombards in 568, left the Eastern 
            Roman Empire only a small strip of coastline in the current Veneto, including Venice. 
            The Roman/Byzantine territory was organized as the Exarchate of Ravenna, administered from that 
            ancient port and overseen by a viceroy (the Exarch) appointed by the Emperor in Constantinople. 
            Ravenna and Venice were connected only by sea routes, and with the Venetians' isolation came 
            increasing autonomy. New ports were built, including those at Malamocco and Torcello in the 
            Venetian lagoon. The tribuni maiores formed the earliest central standing governing committee of 
            the islands in the lagoon, dating from c. 568.
